How to set up for in-memory testing:

- persistenceold.xml is the persistence file for PHYSICAL MYSQL database while the persistence.xml is set up for H2 in memory mode.
- download and add h2*.jar from http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html into the project dependecies
- EXTRA: add the hamcrest jar from /lib to your project dependency to utilize hamcrest matchers

Note: you cannot run Main.java with the current persistence.xml. Rename persistenceold.xml to persistence.xml or change the contents of persistence.xml to reflect the appropriate persistence info
